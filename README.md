# WHATCARDWHEN?

## Run app locally
- Start frontend: `npm run dev`
- Start backend: `cd backend && npm run dev`

## Troubleshooting node_modules stuff
- I was having trouble with my node_modules. Something that worked was deleting the package-lock.json file and running `rm -rf node_modules` and then running `npm install`.
